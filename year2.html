                <p class="description-text">This design is an ecology center located in Commons Ford Ranch. Within its program it has three
                    main categories; admin community, and support. The idea was to be able to have a place where
                    people that are visiting the park are able to learn about the plant life and the environment around
                    them.
                    There was a thought process that starting forming while thinking of what the design might look
                    like. Initially it started with checking off the boxes of what was needed for the program. After I was
                    able to arrange them in a way that made sense circulation wise.
                    After coming up with the set program functionalities and where they were going to be placed I
                    then started thinking about how the outside design can start to react to the environmental system
                    around the facility.</p>

            <p class="description-text">The images shows the upper level that has an

                atrium allowing the natural sunlight to alluminate the in-
                terior.
                
                Making this choice led the to the idea of putting the main
                gathering space in the middle of the first floor right under
                the skylight.
                
                The staircase allows people that work there or are just vist-
                ing to be able to get to the second floor while also being able
                
                to sit and rest on the left side of the staircase.
                The main point of the building was to be able to house the
                
                neccessities of the program but also inspire the people visit-
                ing to roam around in the surrounding space.
                
                On the second floor there is a balcony that is connected to
                the uper floor of the facility and is accessed by doors that
                are able to rotate and open up the connection between the
                interior and the exterior.<p>

                <p class="description-text">This project acts as a proposal for the transformation of an
                    existing golf course into a learning center which looks to
                    educate local communities on what natural disasters are,
                    how we contribute to the problem, and how future communities can be
                    developed and built in anticipation of
                    these events.
                    
                    The project proposes the rehabilitation of the
                    local plant fauna while maintaining the existing golf cart
                    paths in order to create a public hiking park which can be
                    enjoyed by anyone and in the case of a natural disaster
                    could be used as shelter through the placement of modular housing
                    units throughout the site, converting the site
                    itself into an exhibit on the potential design and building
                    practices which could one day be utilized in case of the
                    occurrence of natural disasters.</p>

                for Sustainable Housing Emergency Long Term Resillience.
                Our goal with these Sheltrs was to portray examples of
                future housing that accomodate to natural disasters in a
                way that allow the peope that are visiting the park to be
                able to learn and take knowledge back home with them and
                apply them to their own situations. Along with this they
                will be available to the public to rest in during the year and
                during a natural disaster they are designed to house around
                25 people per sheltr set.<p>
